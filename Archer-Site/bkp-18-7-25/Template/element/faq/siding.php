                New siding is a very exciting addition to your home. Maintaining your siding is key to ensure its
                longevity and appearance. Here are some tips on how to maintain your new siding:

                <ul class="mt-2 mb-4 list-style-disc" style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li class="mb-2">Regularly clean your siding. Dirt, grime, and debris can accumulate on your
                        siding, leading to discoloration and damage. You can use a power washer or a garden hose to
                        clean your siding. Avoid using high-pressure water to prevent damage to your siding.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Inspect your siding for damage. Regular inspections can help you identify any
                        issues early on and prevent them from becoming bigger problems. Check for cracks, dents, or
                        scratches and have the siding repaired immediately.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Trim trees and bushes near your siding. Overgrown trees and bushes can scratch
                        and damage your siding. Keep them trimmed to prevent any potential damage.</li>
                    <li>Paint or stain your siding as needed. If you have wood siding, you will need to paint or stain
                        it every few years to protect it from weathering and rot.</li>
                </ul>

                By following these tips, you can help maintain your new siding and keep it looking beautiful for
                years to come. If you have any questions or concerns about your siding maintenance, feel free to

                At Archer Exteriors, we understand that pricing is an important consideration for any renovation
                project. When it comes to siding, there are a few factors that can influence the overall cost of
                your project, including:

                <ul class="mt-2 mb-4 list-style-disc" style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>The size of your home:</b> The larger your home, the more materials and labor
                        will be
                        required to complete the siding project.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>The type of siding you choose:</b> Different siding materials (such as vinyl,
                        wood,
                        and fiber cement) can vary in price, with some options being more expensive than others.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>The condition of your existing siding:</b> If your current siding is damaged
                        or in
                        poor condition, additional work may be required to repair or replace it before new siding can be
                        installed.</li>
                    <li><b>Any additional features or customization:</b> If you want to add features like trim,
                        shutters, or
                        decorative accents, this can add to the overall cost of your new siding project.</li>
                </ul>

                Over time, most siding materials will experience some degree of fading, especially when exposed to
                direct sunlight. However, some materials are more prone to fading than others. For instance, vinyl
                siding is known for its tendency to fade and become brittle over time. On the other hand, fiber
                cement siding and brick tend to hold up better against fading. <br><br>

                Improving your home, specifically your home's siding, comes with an important decision on who to
                trust with the work performed. The best way to choose a great siding company for your project starts
                with making sure the company is licensed and insured. They should also provide an itemized contract
                of all costs, with details on what each material is used for. Finally the siding company should have
                an established reputation in the community. An added bonus is a home renovation company that offers
                industry leading warranties along with easy financing options.

                At Archer Exteriors, we take great care in properly installing vinyl siding to ensure it lasts for
                years to come. Here's a general overview of our installation process:

                <ul class="mt-2 mb-4 list-style-disc" style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>Preparation:</b> We begin by removing any existing siding and inspecting the
                        exterior of the home for any damage or rot that needs repair. We also install a moisture barrier
                        to prevent water from seeping behind the siding.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>Mounting:</b> We install J-channel around windows and doors to provide a
                        secure base for the siding. We also install starter strips at the bottom of the wall to hold the
                        first course of siding in place.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>Siding Installation:</b> We start at the bottom of the wall and work our way
                        up, overlapping each course of siding to prevent gaps and ensure a tight fit. We also make sure
                        to leave room for expansion and contraction due to temperature changes.</li>
                    <li><b>Finishing Touches:</b> We install trim around windows, doors, and corners to complete the
                        look and provide additional protection from the elements.</li>
                </ul>

                Overall, our team of experienced professionals takes great pride in our vinyl siding installation
                process and we're confident that you'll be happy with the results. Contact us today to schedule a
