                New windows refer to windows that are installed in a newly constructed building or a building that
                has never had windows before. Replacement windows, on the other hand, are installed in an existing
                building where the old windows need to be replaced due to damage, wear and tear, or to upgrade the
                building's energy efficiency. <br><br>

                Replacement windows are designed to fit into the existing window frames, while new windows require
                new frames and installation. Replacement windows are a cost-effective option as they don't require
                additional construction work, while new windows are usually more expensive due to the added
                installation and framing costs. <br><br>

                At Archer Exteriors, we offer both new window installation and replacement window services to meet
                our clients' needs. Our team of experts can help you determine the best option for your building and
                provide you with high-quality windows that meet your requirements. Contact us today to schedule a
                consultation.

                The most important things to consider when choosing a good window installer is if they are licensed
                and insured. Window installers should always be licensed and insured. Other important factors
                include their experience working with window replacement installations. At Archer Exteriors we
                always take pride in jobs that are done right the first time. No one wants a leaky window and our

                At Archer Exteriors, we use high-quality replacement windows that are designed to last for decades.
                The lifespan of your replacement windows will depend on a few factors, including the material, the
                brand, and the quality of installation. Typically, vinyl and fiberglass windows can last up to 20-30
                years, while wood windows may last up to 30-50 years with proper maintenance. <br><br>

                that you get the best value for your investment. Our windows team also provides expert installation

                After getting new windows installed, there are a few things you should inspect to ensure that your
                windows are functioning properly and that your home is protected from the elements. <br><br>

                Firstly, check that the windows are properly sealed and caulked around the frame. This will prevent
                drafts and water from entering your home. You should also look for any gaps or spaces between the
                window frame and the wall, and make sure that they are properly insulated. <br><br>

                Next, test the windows to make sure they open and close smoothly and securely. Check that the
                locking mechanism is working properly and that the window stays open at the desired angle. <br><br>

                Lastly, inspect the glass for any cracks or damage. If you notice any issues with the glass, contact
                your Archer Exteriors team immediately to have them repaired. <br><br>

                By inspecting your new windows regularly, you can ensure that they are performing at their best and
                protecting your home for years to come.
