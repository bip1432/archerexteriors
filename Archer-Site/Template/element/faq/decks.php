                At Archer Exteriors, we understand that choosing the right decking material for your new deck can be
                overwhelming. Here are a few factors to consider when making your decision:

                <ul class="mt-2 mb-4 list-style-disc" style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>Budget:</b> The cost of decking can vary greatly depending on the materials
                        chosen. Wood is typically
                        less expensive than composite or PVC decking.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>Maintenance:</b> Some decking materials require more maintenance than others.
                        Wood decking needs to
                        be stained or sealed regularly to prevent rot and decay. Composite and PVC decking require less
                        maintenance but may need to be cleaned periodically.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><b>Durability:</b> Different decking materials have different levels of
                        durability. Composite and PVC
                        decking are more resistant to moisture, insects, and rot than wood decking.</li>
                    <li><b>Aesthetics:</b> The look and feel of your deck is important. Different decking materials
                        come in a
                        variety of colors and textures, so be sure to choose a material that complements your home's
                        exterior.</li>
                </ul>

                needs and budget. Contact us today to learn more about our decking services.

                The timeline for installing a new deck can vary depending on several factors such as the size of the
                deck, the materials used, and the complexity of the design. However, at Archer Exteriors, we strive
                to complete all our projects as efficiently as possible without compromising quality. <br><br>

                Typically, the installation process for a standard deck can take anywhere from two to four weeks.
                This includes the time it takes to obtain necessary permits, preparing the site for construction,
                building the deck frame, installing the decking, and finishing touches. <br><br>

                We understand that having construction work done at your home can be disruptive, which is why we
                work closely with our clients to schedule the project at a time that is convenient for them. Our
                team of skilled professionals will also keep you updated on the progress of the project to ensure
                that you are aware of any changes or delays. <br><br>

                If you have any specific questions about the timeline for your deck installation or any other
                renovation projects, please don't hesitate to contact us. We'd be happy to discuss your options and
                provide you with a detailed estimate of the project timeline and cost.

                The optimal time to install a new deck is during the late spring, summer, or early fall when the
                weather is warm and dry. This allows for proper curing of the wood and ensures that the sealant or
                stain properly adheres to the surface. However, our team at Archer Exteriors can install decks
                year-round as long as the weather permits. We will work with you to find a time that fits your
                schedule and the weather conditions.

                adding a
                deck can increase the resale value of your home by up to 76% of the cost of the deck. In addition, a
                deck can enhance the livability of your home and provide additional outdoor living space for your
                family and friends to enjoy.
