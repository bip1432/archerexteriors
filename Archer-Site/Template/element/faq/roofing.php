                Archer Exteriors offers a wide range of roofing materials to suit your needs, preferences, and
                budget. Some of the most popular types of roofing materials that we install are:
                <ul class="mt-2 list-style-disc" style="list-style: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                    <li class="mb-3"><b>Asphalt shingles:</b> Asphalt are the most common and affordable
                            roofing material in North America. Shingles made of asphalt are easy to install, repair,
                        and replace. Asphalt roofs come in different styles, colors, and designs to match any home
                        style. These shingles have a good fire resistance rating and can withstand moderate winds and
                        hail. However, asphalt shingles have a shorter lifespan than other roofing materials, typically
                        lasting 15 to 20 years. They are also prone to fading, cracking, curling, and algae growth over
                        time. They are not very eco-friendly, as they contribute to landfill waste and greenhouse gas
                        emissions.</li>

                    <li class="mb-3"><b>Metal roofing:</b> These are made from various metals, such as steel,
                        aluminum, copper, or zinc. Metal roofs have a modern and sleek appearance that
                        can complement any home style. Metal roofing materials are extremely durable and long-lasting,
                        with a lifespan of 50 years or more. These roofs are resistant to fire, wind, hail, corrosion,
                        and pests. A good metal roof has a high reflectivity value and can help reduce heat gain and
                        cooling costs. Another bonus to metal roofing is the environmentally friendly factor as they are
                        recyclable and energy-efficient. However, a metal roof can be more expensive than asphalt
                        shingles, both in terms of material and installation costs. They also tend to be noisy during
                        rain or hail storms. Finally, consider that a roof made out of metal may dent or scratch easily
                        if not properly installed or maintained.</li>

                The time it takes to replace a roof depends on several factors, such as the type and
                quantity of the material, the size and complexity of your house, the weather conditions, and the
                availability of the crew. Generally speaking, it takes about one to three days to replace a roof
                with asphalt shingles, and about three to five days to replace a roof with metal or tile roofing.
                However, these times are only estimates and may vary depending on your specific situation. Archer
                Exteriors will give you an estimated timeline for your roof replacement project when we provide you
                with a free inspection and estimate.

                Roof flashing is a thin material, typically made of metal, that is installed on the roof to prevent
                water from seeping into the roofing system. It is usually placed around areas of the roof where
                water is most likely to penetrate, such as chimneys, vents, skylights, and valleys. <br><br>

                The purpose of roof flashing is to redirect water away from these vulnerable areas and onto the
                shingles or tiles, where it can safely drain off the roof. Without proper flashing, water can seep
                into the roof and cause damage to the underlying structure, as well as lead to leaks and other
                problems. <br><br>

                At Archer Exteriors, we specialize in installing and repairing all types of roof flashing to ensure
                that your roof is protected from water damage.

                Drip Edge is a type of flashing that is installed at the edges of a roof to prevent water from

                or plastic and is shaped like an L or T to fit over the edge of the roof. <br><br>

                Drip Edge is an important component of any roofing system as it helps to protect the roof and the

                Underlayment is a layer of material that is installed between the roof deck and the shingles or
                other roofing material. It serves as a secondary layer of protection against water infiltration and
                helps to keep the roof deck dry. Underlayment is an essential component of any roofing system and is
                available in a variety of materials, including felt, synthetic, and rubberized asphalt. <br><br>

                The lifespan of a roof can vary depending on the type of material used, the quality of installation,
                and the climate. Generally speaking, a standard asphalt shingle roof can last anywhere from 15 to 25
                years. However, some high-quality shingle roofs can last up to 50 years. <br><br>

                Metal roofs can last even longer, with a lifespan of 50 to 75 years. Other factors that can affect
                the lifespan of a roof include the maintenance it receives, the frequency of severe weather events,
                and the level of exposure to sunlight. <br><br>

                It's important to have your roof inspected regularly by a professional to ensure that it remains in
                good condition and to address any issues before they become major problems. <br><br>

                At Archer Exteriors, we offer comprehensive roof inspections, repairs, and replacements to keep your
                home protected for years to come.
