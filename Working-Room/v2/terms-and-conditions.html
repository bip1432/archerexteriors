      <h5 class="title_4 mb-2">Informal Negotiations</h5>
      <p class="mb-4">To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these
        Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a
        “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except
        those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.
        Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>

      <h5 class="title_4 mb-2">Binding Arbitration</h5>
      <p class="mb-3">If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except
        those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved through binding arbitration.
        YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The
        arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
        Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
        ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website: <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
        shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such
        costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The
        arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator
        will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party.
        The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
        Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place
        in Salem, New Jersey. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
        arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
        entered by the arbitrator.</p>

      <p class="mb-3">If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be
        commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Salem, New Jersey, and the Parties hereby
        consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to
        venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on
        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) is
        excluded from these Terms of Use.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced
        more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or
        unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this
        provision found to be illegal or unenforceable, and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
        jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal
        jurisdiction of that court.</p>

      <h5 class="title_4 mb-2">Restrictions</h5>
      <p class="mb-5">The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
        individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;
        (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class
        action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.</p>

      <h5 class="title_4 mb-2">Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h5>
      <p class="mb-5">The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning
        informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
        validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from,
        allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.
        If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
        Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute
        shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
        Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
